1) I tried my best to satisfy all the requirements.

2) The app is responsive and has separate style file that has "tweakable" style settings, such as dimensions, font sizes,
etc.

3) The only issue with the app is that fitering and refreshing the page after deleting a event are not working together properly, 
I tried to find a way to do this but, I was not able to find a proper solution

4) So currently after deleting a element, the page will be refreshed with updated elements only if you manually refresh it.

5)Used Axios to do HTTP requests - intresting read as to why this is better than fetch API - https://link.medium.com/QNe8f3QlVY
